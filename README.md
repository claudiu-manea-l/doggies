# Android Technical Assignment
## Task
You need to develop an app that would use the Dog Breeds API to allow users to
browse through the list of dog breeds, their pictures, and add pictures to favorites.

## App Structure
We expect your app to have three screens with following features:
1. List of Breeds
- Shows the list of available breeds
- Navigates the app to screen 2 when the user taps any of the breeds
- Has “favorites” button that navigates the app to screen 3
2. Breed Pictures
- Shows all the available pictures of a given breed
- Allows users to like/unlike specific images by tapping the image or a like button
3. Favorite Pictures
- Shows the images that the user liked
- Shows which breed a particular image belongs to
- Allows user to filter images by selecting a breed.

## Requirements
- You should use the following API: https://dog.ceo/dog-api
- Your app should be written in Kotlin

## Practicalities
- We are not expecting you to spend more than 1 day (or 8 hours) on this
assignment, but this is not a strict limitation. Feel free to exceed that time, if you
feel like it.
- Once your assignment is ready, please share it via GitHub
- Be prepared to the possibility to showcase your solution during a technical
interview. In that case, you would be asked to run the app and show your
solution from the user perspective, as well as to present the codebase,
highlighting the most compelling parts of the solution, before answering ad-hoc
questions concerning your app.
